# DWSIM_Automation

DWSIM Automation Repository

This repository contains code and scripts for automating unit operations simulated in DWSIM, an open-source process simulator. It provides tools to streamline workflows, automate repetitive tasks, and integrate DWSIM simulations with external applications. The codebase includes examples for scripting unit operations, managing simulation parameters, and extracting results programmatically. Designed for engineers and researchers, it supports Python-based automation through DWSIM's API, enabling efficient process design and optimization.

Key features:
Automation scripts for unit operations (e.g., reactors, distillation columns, heat exchangers)
Integration with DWSIM's Python interface for simulation control
Examples for input parameter manipulation and output data extraction
Modular and reusable code structure for custom workflows
Documentation for setup, usage, and extension
Ideal for chemical engineering applications, process optimization, and batch simulation tasks.
